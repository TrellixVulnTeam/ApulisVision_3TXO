## Introduction

ApulisVision is a high level computer vision toolbox based on **mmdetection**,  besides the **Object Detection** Module, We have supported **Image Classification** and **Semantic Segmantation**. ApulisVision is a part of the open source project developed by [ApulisTech](https://github.com/apulis).

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3 to 1.5**, and it is based mmdetection-v2.0.

## Main Support
- [x] [Image Classification](/docs/Image-classification.md)
- [x] [Object Detection](/docs/Object-detection.md)
- [x] [Semantic Segmantation](/docs/Semantic-segmantation.md)

## Installation

Please refer to [install.md](docs/install.md) for installation and dataset preparation.

## Getting Started

Please see [getting_started.md](docs/getting_started.md) for the basic usage of MMDetection. There are also tutorials for [finetuning models](docs/tutorials/finetune.md), [adding new dataset](docs/tutorials/new_dataset.md), [designing data pipeline](docs/tutorials/data_pipeline.md), and [adding new modules](docs/tutorials/new_modules.md).

## Contributing

We appreciate all contributions to improve MMDetection. Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contributing guideline.

## Acknowledgement

MMDetection is an open source project that is contributed by researchers and engineers from various colleges and companies. We appreciate all the contributors who implement their methods or add new features, as well as users who give valuable feedbacks.
We wish that the toolbox and benchmark could serve the growing research community by providing a flexible toolkit to reimplement existing methods and develop their own new detectors.
